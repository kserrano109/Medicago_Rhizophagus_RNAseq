# Medicago_Rhizophagus_RNAseq

This is a repository for the publication "Spatially-Resolved, Single Cell Transcriptome Mapping of the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis" in which authors applied single-nuclei RNA-seq and spatial RNA-seq to the symbiosis between Medicago truncatula and Rhizophagus irregularis.

There are two branches: Spatial-Visium and sNuc-Chromium. R scripts for these analyses will be found within the respective branch. 
Each figure within the manuscript also has a corresponding code file in the main branch.
